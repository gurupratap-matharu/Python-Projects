Veer,
    You know what's the best way to learn to code?

We are around 4 months into computer programming and I feel we have really grasped some basics very well.
I would suggest that don't be running around tutorials or documentation.

This field, like any other science field, is very vast and enormous. The best way is to fire up the terminal and start writing code without any help.

1. Simply think of a simple idea and try to implement it
2. Make small modules which work well. Grow gradually.
3. Refer to documentation and google search or stackoverflow when you are unsure. The help commands are your best friends here.
4. Upload your small projects on git and social media sites.
5. In theory we need to learn Algorithms and Data Structures. We already have books on that
6. Pick up module and practise it completely. Our experience will teach us the best.
7. Never ever copy code. It will do a lot of harm and make us feel weak. Yes, we can surely read well written codes on github for inspirations and best practices.
8. Visualize a problem, a really simple one, in the real world and think how we can make something for free to solve it. This is the heart of it.
9. Always try different types of projects so that we gain a diverse experience.
10. Enjoy. I know you enjoy programming. I don't know how this has happened. I never expected it. But so be it. I am here to enjoy the ride with you.

Your inner voice.
