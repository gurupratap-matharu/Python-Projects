<h1>Letter to my Papa</h1>

<p>Dear Papa,
	I cannot tell you how much I miss you after you have gone. All your life you worked hard for us and I couldn't get even a single chance to serve you back.
Somehow this fact is not acceptable to me and I wish to give back to you as a dutiful son. Your absence has made me realised the importance of you in my life. Without you I often feel lost - like a sheep without a shepherd. Everything that I am or will become I completely owe to you and I am forever in your debt. Without you I cease to exist and there is nothing I want except to make you proud of me. That will be biggest victory of my life. 
	Out there in the heavens I hope you watch and guide me in my life. I don't know what is there after life but I will remember your teachings. This is the way you live inside me. Whenever in doubt, please whisper silently in my mind and I will understand. This shall be our golden secret.

I always love you.
