Today I met Tatiana Carerra in the hostel.
A photographer from Brazil she is quite a character. Sends me a message via instagram sending her
whatsapp and looks like she's interested.

Looking at her she looks like in her early 40's and has this beautiful curly golden brown hair. 
Dresses really well and like how a well educated lady should be.

We crossed paths at the terrace and sparks flew. I'm glad in the way how I keep my calm and act smooth
like the Bond. Haha
May I should invite her for a glass of wine and some nice dinner. She'd like that. I'm sure she 
would.

Argentina has taught me to make girls drunk and see what happens. Everyone feels a bit relaxed and 
I myself am a very jovial person when drunk.
Honestly, I really like that side of me.


It would be interesting to see what Tatiana thinks of me. May be a kiss with her won't do any harm.
Haha :-)

Actually, this feeling of people being interested in you is great and very warm.
I feel young and excited like a kid.
This should be interesting.


Guys I'll keep you updated about my news with Tatiana.
