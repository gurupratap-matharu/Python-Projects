Dear Argentina,
	Thank you for accepting me and teaching me so many new things. I have completely changed in yourcompany and your are beautiful in all respects. Such a marvellous country and after spending two years over here I really feel at home.
Your culture is vivid and very different from mine but at the same time we have a lot of resemblances I feel. I don't feel any negative thoughts or regrets in my mind about coming here. I owe you till my lifeI feel like I owe India.
I don't know about you but I have accepted as you my mother as well. Since you have changed me so much
now I want to give you back in someway or the other.

By my gut instinct I should rather write, do scientific research or computer programming. That way I cansolve many problems that Argentina is facing at the moment. So that we all can be better.
I want to contribute to the country and to this world by the little talent that I have.

I think that's the best way. Computer programming, techonology and artificial intelligence can be very powerful. I strongly feel I am capable to handle all of it. Make me disciplined and allow me to do it.
There is bright future ahead and I don't want to waste even one more single second on things that don't matter.

Life is short and from today let me think differently and uniquely. Anywhere I go in this world I am 
bound to face this dilemma of "whethere this is the right place?" Well it turns out that Argentina and Montserrat where I am currently are the right places for me.

Please take me out of me comfort zone and let me fly. Free, without fears and inhibitions. I am completely capable to do them. Bless me as a mother Argentina and have faith in me. For I have faith in you.

I love you.
Veer
