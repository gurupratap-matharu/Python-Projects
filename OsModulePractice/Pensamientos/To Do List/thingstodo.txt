Thank you O'Lord Almighty for giving me this beautiful day.
I feel really blessed. Everything that you give to me or take
away from me is acceptable to me.

Allow me to learn more and bring goodness to your life. I don't want any
thing more.

PAPA I MISS YOU!
Make me a person like you - calm, content, peaceful, hardworking and religious.

Golu don't waste a single moment and make most of what you have. 
You are already doing very well and I like your attitude. Be calm, hardworking, do not procrastinate
and keep rising again and again like a true Hero.

Leave this import export agent job. You are meant for bigger things. All your failures are teachers
about success in your life.
Go step by step and build a solid foundation.


Be a man of lots of actions and very few words. This is what matters. Everything else is a lie!

May papajis soul rest in peace. Death is a very humbling thing. I realise life is so short I have 
absolutely nothing to be proud of.

I surrender completely to Lord O Almighty, His creation is truly beautiful.
