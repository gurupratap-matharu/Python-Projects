Golu,

Don't worry be happy. Life is short and not worth worrying.

Don't be too hard on yourself. Go step by step and all the things will fall into place.
Life is not a race. Enjoy these days like anything. 

Meet people, get drunk, learn new things, work, study and exercise.

That's what life is all about. It's good that you like religion and want to know more about science.
Keep your progress up and you'll find your way.

Papa is there with you. Our only competition is with our ownself.
That's it.

Repeatedly do things that you like and excel at them.

Don't be too distracted. We have very very limited time and energy and we should focus on only what we
are interested in. Say NO to things, ideas, thoughts and people. No harm in it.

Mom loves you and your family is very worried about you. 
Earn good money and instead of doing a job try to start your own small business online or in Argentina.

So many people can do it. You toh are a special kind of person. You can certainly do it.

One day will come when you are going to look back at yourself and cherish these days. Because life is 
all about living in the present. There is zero and absolutely nothing neither in the future nor in 
the past.

Life is whats happening to you RIGHT NOW!!!
So why do you feel any worried. You like a brave guy have come such a long way that too alone.

Start doing things and keep putting in those efforts and I'm very convinced that you are going to 
go a long way in your life.
So many people around you have confidence in you.

Make the right decisions and never ever complicate things. You are nobody's agent or middle man.

Do you own thing. Inface show other people how it's supposed to be done as well.
You are completely and totally defined by all your failures. They construct and give shape to your
personality. Be proud to have found them in your life. It surely means you are living and trying 
something new.


Go ahead my boy. I am always with you.

Your inner voice.
