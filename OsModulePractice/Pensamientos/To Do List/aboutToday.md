Great things done yesterday Golu.
I am happy for you. Keep the studying streak going on at full swing.

Its really important that we pass these exams at any cost. you are capable and can do it.

Do not think too much in the future and work really well in the present moment. All these efforts will
not go into waste. Believe me on this.

Keep solving Maths problems on 
Calculus - Analisis Matematico I
Algebra
Physics - Laws and formulae

Astronomy

Read on the obras as much as you can and the context of situation of Argentina at that time. You shall pass literatura as well.

Its this time or never. Hard work will always pay off. 

Don't break your head over import export. You are not meant to be an agent. No.
Focus on creating a profile on Upwork, Freelancer and Angel. But first make your
1. Linkedin Profile
2. Github profilt
3. Twitter
4. CV

then contact developer jobs for remote work. Start small and I'm sure this will work.

You are talented. In training

Do the projects of 
1. Automate the boring stuff with Python - Upload on Github
2. 10 Python Applications
3. A bit of Corey schafer



These things are more than enought to start on with freelancing.

Remember. Do not waste time thinking too much. Just act. Manytimes these complicated things can be solved within an hour.

Act fast, make quick decisions and start working. We should work and be financially independent.
I know things cannot change in one day. But start now, Do littel today and it'll all shape up very beautifully.

I am with you in this.
Golu
