Good morning World!!

Thank you God for this beautiful day and such a nice rest at night.
I feel better today and wish to do many things.

Allow me to focus on small things and finish them. Let me conquer small battles and then gradually
move on to bigger things.

Today Golu,
	shouldn't waste a single bit of time.
1. Practice Python classes and little bit of Matplot and numpy
2. Read on Martin Fierro, Biografia de Taedeo Cruz y su intertextualidad. Also glance on Operacion Masacre de Rodolfo Walsh
3. Fix your looks and pray. Clean up your room as well.
4. Go to La Plata. You should solve Physics and astronomy problems.
5. Basic Exercise and trim body hair
6. Eat really well
7. Make 1st draft of developer CV
8. 30 mins Guitar scales.
9. Speak to family

Remember that it's better to focus rather than wandering. Repitition is the key to success.

I love you. Take care.
