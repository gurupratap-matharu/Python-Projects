Today is a very beautiful day and Lord Almighty has blessed me with another day.
I feel energetic, calm and content.

Papa I miss you and want to be like you. Please give me peace, hard work capabilities, patience and 
make me religious.

Life is short and I want to do all the things today itself.

Golu,

start today and don't waste a second.
