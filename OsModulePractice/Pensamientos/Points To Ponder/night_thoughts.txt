Veer,

today has been a really productive day.
We are understanding more and more about human behaviour and the way people react.
I am glad that you have started to live "outside your head" and have started thinking more
from others point of view.

Life is hard but it's not a rat race. Always remember this. No matter what you do you are always going to find a lot competition.
Don't be bogged down by this. You are here in this world not because you are in someone's debt.

You are born free to enjoy this world and have a beautiful journey.

Till now we aren't in anyone's debt. We only need to payback our family and solve world problems.

Haha ;-)

Keep working hard and always be as crazy as you are. Remember to hit it directly at the point reather than beating around the bush.

Act fast and never procrastinate. Life is just like an ice cream and we need to enjoy it before
it melts.

Pray to God each day and thank him for this beautiful universe.

Make good and great things out of your talent. Make them for free!!
the best things in life come for free and you very well know that.


Now, I have got to learn some artificial intelligence. So see you around.

Love

Veer
