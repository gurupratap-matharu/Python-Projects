Today was a difficult day. Golu but you still handed it really well. Days like these pass and all you
can do is to keep yourself occupied and look ahead for better times.
To handle so much solitude all alone make you tougher from inside and it's changing you but heroes
don't complain.
Everybody in our family has problems and difficulties. You are not the only one. Inface you are not 
having any major responsibility. 
God. Please give me some.
Universe is a very strange place. It doesn't work according to our thoughts or feelings and neither we
are the center of it. This is a hard fact and we should accept is Now.
Nothing really matter in the end and when your life will be coming to an end Golu do you think the 
problems you think you have in Argentina will even matter?
Think about it for a second.

What happened to you in school, infosys or prasad is the past and you don't remember anything now. Correct? So what do you fear? Just be yourself and do as much as you can with a good hardworking attitude.
All rest will fall into place.
Don't let some small failures affect you as you have gained so much here. Do not procrastinate and work
very hard. Let's accept this right now itself.
ACTIONS SPEAK A THOUSAND TIMES LOUDER THAN WORDS.
We should be acting fast and quick without wasting minutes. This is it.

From this moment onwards. Stop crumbling and start acting towards your dreams and goals. Take small steps no matter how small they are. You are good at learning and taking criticism. Thinks will click in no time. Be fearless and bold. You are a courageous man. So don't let anything deter you. 

Act on small things that you learn rather than putting things on the back burner. It's really now in themoment or never. Life is really what is happening to us now.
I don't have much to say here as you already know a lot. We are together in this. Lets fight it out together. Now go and take rest.
I'm with you. 

Your inner voice.
