Dear God,

	Thank for the new small change that you have already brought into my life.
I know that different things can happen to me only when I try and implement different things.

This is the way I wish to build up and you are guiding me there. Now, I wish to face all my fears and work hard.
The best way to solve your problems is to face them.
I am a capable and responsible person and can take myself out of my depression. No one else but me and 
only me can help myself.

So be it. 

I shall walk like a hero and make things happen. Beyond all I wish to be a man of actions. Actions and 
only actions. Talk less and do a thousand times more.
Actions speak very much louder than words. That's it.

Golu, you have 2 hours more today. Make them count and do new things. Enjoy your life to the fullest and
don't regret anything.

Calculus, physics, algebra and lengua y literatura are small creatures who are very easy. They just seemto be humngous to you because you are not facing them.

Time to go out and start doing.
You are already on a very good start as only when you accept and confess your defeat you have already risen very high and half the battle is won.

I love you.


Your Inner Voice.
