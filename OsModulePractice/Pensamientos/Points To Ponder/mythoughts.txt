Golu today is a new day.
It's a another opportunity for us. Your thoughts and thinking process after our recent failures 
has changed so much!

The way you have learnt from your business meetings, youtube videos, hostel life and travelling
journey is absolutely amazing.

What more do we have to lose?

Dust off all the problems that you had yesterday and start again today. You are very well advancing
on the road to success. That's what makes us and defines us. The choices that we make.

Live on less, travel, fail, experiment and have the courage to admit.

May God bless you.

Go take a cold shower bath and start again today.

The most valuable thing that we have is TIME and our family. Don't lose them.

All rest doesn't matter.
Remeber the story of the rose in a garden of million roses? Life is not at all a race and is not 
meant to be lived that way. That's a very pessimistic view on life.

Your only competition is your yesterday. You should only be better off your yesterday. Don't fall into
any trap and keep going strong.


Always, always, always take the road less travelled.

You are bound to hit diamonds.

You inner voice.
