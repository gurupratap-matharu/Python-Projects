Thank you O'Lord Almighty for this beautiful day!

Please fill my life with hard word and hope. I wish to rise again and again as many times that I fall.
Today is a new day Veer. All of life is in the present and we should live in the moment.

Forget about planning in the future.
Start doing on whatever you can get your hands on. Life is too short.
Today please make your developer CV and start applying for jobs.

Upload your projects on GitHub and make a nice profile.

Rather build simple applications than chasing others. Develop the shine and potential within you.

Do not waste time chasing women. Its a big no-no

Clear all 5 exams that are due and visit UNGS and reinscribe in CAU as well.
1. Solve SBI credit card problem
2. Go for some exercise
3. Cut your hair and look handsome
4. Give clothes for washing
5. Read a lot
6. Solve mathematics. You learn only by doing
7. Go slow and step by step. Be the tortoise in the race of life. Slow and steady wins the race.
8. Greatness from small beginnings.
9. Veer be a man of a lots of actions and very few words. Actions speak much louder than words.
10. May God bless you and have a nice day ahead.
