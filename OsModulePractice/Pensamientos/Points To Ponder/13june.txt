Golu don't worry too much.

Just keep on taking actions and always follow your gut instinct.

Everything in this world has a reason. You have already realized it.
You are on the right path. It's the core quality of a hero to believe in himself when the
while world doesn't believe in him.

Rise and rise again until lambs become Lions!!!
