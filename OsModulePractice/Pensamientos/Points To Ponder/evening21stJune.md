Hi Veer,

Amazing are your efforts. May God bless you.

All this practice won't go in vain. You are constantly striving to learn more and more. I have lot of confidence and faith and you.

Remember, in the process of learning. Doing things yourself is the only way.

Videos and reading you may forget. Keep practicing unless it becomes second nature to you and comes effortlessly to you.

That's the way to go ahead. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it.
You are completely capable to do it. So go ahead my boy and conquer the world.

Take quick decisions and make most of every minute that you have. May God bless you and may you great things in this world and bring positive changes in the life of the people.
Dream really really big and you can do it. I am very confident of you.

I amm with you in this game of life.

Good luck.

you Inner Voice.
